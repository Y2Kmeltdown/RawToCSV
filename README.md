# RawToCSV
Simple Script to convert Raw files generated through the metavision toolbox to CSV files
## Requirements
To use the script you will need to have the metavision toolbox from prophesee installed along with the [neuromorphic command line tools](https://github.com/neuromorphic-paris/command_line_tools).
## How to use
To use the script replace the three paths at the top of the script with the appropriate paths from your device and simply run the script and select the raw files you want to convert. The script will take all the raw files and convert them to DAT files, ES files and CSV files in the same location as the original file.
